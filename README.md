## Overview

This repository contains PyTorch code for the message-passing GAN ([MPGAN](mpgan/model.py)) and generative adversarial particle transformer ([GAPT]((gapt/model.py))) models, as well as scripts for [training](train.py) the models from scratch, [generating](gen.py) and [plotting](plotting.py) the particle clouds. 
We include also [weights](trained_models) of fully trained models discussed in [2]. 

Additionally, we release the standalone [JetNet](https://github.com/jet-net/JetNet) library, which provides a PyTorch Dataset class for our JetNet dataset, implementations of the evaluation metrics discussed in the paper, and some more useful utilities for development in machine learning + jets.

*For the exact code and scripts used for [2], please see the [neurips21](https://github.com/rkansal47/MPGAN/tree/neurips21) branch.*

## Talks

A complete list of talks can be found [here](https://www.raghavkansal.com/project/graph-gan/).

## Dependencies

#### MPGAN and GAPT Models

 - `torch >= 1.8.0`

#### Training, Plotting, Evaluation

 - `torch >= 1.8.0`
 - `jetnet >= 0.2.1`
 - `numpy >= 1.21.0`
 - `matplotlib`
 - `mplhep`

 Can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### External models also require

 - `torch`
 - `torch_geometric`


A Docker image containing all necessary libraries can be found [here](https://gitlab-registry.nautilus.optiputer.net/raghsthebest/mnist-graph-gan:nov22) ([Dockerfile](Dockerfile)).


## Training

Start training with:

```python
python train.py --name test_model --model [model] --jets [jets] [args]  
```

where `model` can be specified as `mpgan` or `gapt`, and jets can be any out of `['g', 't', 'q', 'w', 'z']`.

By default, model parameters, figures of particle and jet features, and plots of the training losses and evaluation metrics over time will be saved every five epochs in an automatically created `outputs/[name]` directory.

Some notes:
 - Will run on a GPU by default if available. 
 - The default arguments correspond to the final model architecture and training configuration used in the paper. 
 - Run `python train.py --help` or look at [setup_training.py](setup_training.py) for a full list of arguments.
 - For protoyping purposes, models can also be trained on a 'sparsified' MNIST point cloud dataset as in [1] using `train_mnist.py`. Normal MNIST training and testing `.csv`s need to be downloaded and pointed to with the `--datasets-path` arg.


## Generation

Pre-trained generators with saved state dictionaries and arguments can be used to generate samples with, for example:

```python
python gen.py --G-state-dict trained_models/mp_g/G_best_epoch.pt --G-args trained_models/mp_g/args.txt --num-samples 50000 --output-file trained_models/mp_g/gen_jets.npy
```
